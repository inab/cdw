Clinical Data Warehouse
===
The purpose of this Project is to build an open-source, scalable data warehouse that will ensure the integration of multiple types of omics/bioinformatics data with deep clinical phenotype information obtained from clinical databases, registries and biobanks.

The European Project RD-Connect (http://rd-connect.eu/) supports this effort providing the resources and the uses cases that will drive the development of this data warehouse. In particular the system developed will be the main outcome of the projectâ€™s WP5 in which several groups participate. (for the full list of partners in the consortium see http://rd-connect.eu/about/partners/)

Due to the complexity of this task we would like to encourage all people to contribute with comments and issues/bug fixes requests. The project Wiki and the issue requests system will be the main channels for this communication.
